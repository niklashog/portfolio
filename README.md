# My web portfolio

This project is a responsive single page application that highlights my education, skills and contact information. No bootstraps on this one.

## About the project

This website is part of my two year education towards becoming a .NET developer. 
The website was built to put my developer self on the web and my contact info at your fingertips.
The goal is to make it easier for future employers to get a decent understanding of who I am, what I know, and how I could contribute.
