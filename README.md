# About the project

This project is a responsive, single page application - structured with display: flex - that highlights my education, skills and contact information. No bootstraps on this one. 

..part of my two-year education towards becoming a .NET developer. 
..built to put my developer self on the web and my contact info at your fingertips.
..goal is to make it easier for future employers to get a decent understanding of who I am, what I know, and how I could contribute.
..cv available for download. Is nice.
